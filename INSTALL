Currently the program must be built from source, so assume a working gcc C compiler/toolchain.

cd into the src directory.
There is a simple but functional Makefile.
The code can be built to use with GTK2 or GTK3, as determined at the top of the Makefile,
leave as GTK_VERSION = 2 for GTK2, change it to GTK_VERSION = 3 for GTK3.
Then just run 'make' (without the quotes of course) from within the src directory.
It should build without warnings.

The build artefacts, including the executable 'progandscicalc', will be placed under a dir called 'build'
ie. after running 'make' you will find the executable under
  src/build/progandscicalc
The executable can then be copied to wherever you want.

Running 'make clean' will remove all build artefacts.


Dependencies
============
Requires GTK2 or GTK3 libraries, including the gtk2 or gtk3 dev lib (on xubuntu
system this was package libgtk2.0-dev for GTK2, broadly similar for GTK3).
Essentially, whatever you need to build a GTK program from source.
