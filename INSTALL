Currently the program must be built from source, so assume a working gcc C compiler/toolchain.

cd into the src directory.
There is a simple but functional Makefile.
The code can be built to use with GTK2 or GTK3, as determined at the top of the Makefile,
leave as GTK_VERSION = 2 for GTK2, change it to GTK_VERSION = 3 for GTK3.
Then just run 'make' (without the quotes of course) from within the src directory.
It should build without warnings.
(Having said that, with newer gcc version I am now getting one harmless -Wstringop-truncation warning.
Also, when building for GTK2 on a newer setup Xubuntu 20.04, I am now getting lots of
-Wdeprecated-declarations warnings from within the gtk headers. In this case it may be worth
adding -Wno-deprecated-declarations to CFLAGS in the Makefile to get rid of the noise).

The build artefacts, including the executable 'progandscicalc', will be placed under a dir called 'build'
ie. after running 'make' you will find the executable under
  src/build/progandscicalc
The executable can then be copied to wherever you want.

Running 'make clean' will remove all build artefacts.


Dependencies
============
Requires GTK2 or GTK3 libraries, including the gtk2 or gtk3 dev lib (on xubuntu
system this was package libgtk2.0-dev for GTK2, broadly similar for GTK3).
Essentially, whatever you need to build a GTK program from source.
