Currently the program must be built from source, so assume a working gcc C compiler/toolchain.

cd into the src directory.
There is a simple but functional Makefile.
Just run 'make' (without the quotes of course) from within the src directory.
It should build without warnings.

The build artefacts, including the executable 'progandscicalc', will be placed under a dir called 'build'
ie. after running 'make' you will find the executable under
  src/build/progandscicalc
The executable can then be copied to wherever you want.

Running 'make clean' will remove all build artefacts.


Dependencies
============
Requires GTK2 libraries, including the gtk2 dev lib (on xubuntu system
